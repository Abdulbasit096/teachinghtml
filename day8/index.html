                        Blogr features an exceedingly intuitive interface which lets you
                        focus on one thing: creating content. The editor supports

                        embeds such as images, videos, and Markdown. Extensibility with
                        plugins and themes provide easy ways to add functionality or
                        change the looks of a blog.
